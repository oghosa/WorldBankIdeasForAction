2015-1,2015,1,Creating New Microinsurance Products for Remittance Service Providers in India,https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/22542/K8401.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y,,,India,"Remittance, 
Microinsurance",,"Remittances represent significant financial flows between both developing and developed countries that have rapidly increased in volume in recent years. Families who are dependent on remittances from family members abroad are generally in a position of higher risk, and microinsur- ance is well suited to reducing the risk of lower-income families. Currently, India constitutes the largest proportion of global remittances received. Because a strong microinsurance infrastructure already exists there as well, India is a prime target for our solution. We chose to focus our analysis specifically on the corridor (flow) of remittances from the United Arab Emirates because it is the largest source of remittances to India. In addi- tion, this corridor’s primary demographic consists of poorer Indian migrants working in high-risk occupations like construction.
Our proposal recommends two new forms of microinsurance, which we have coined “income stream insurance” (ISI) and “family remittance insur- ance” (FRI). ISI insures the stream of income sent from migrant workers to their home countries in case they meet with an accident or fall sick. FRI directs a portion of the remittance stream into health microinsurance to help protect the livelihood of the migrant workers’ families. An essential element of this idea is a partnership between remittance service providers (RSPs) and microfinance institutions (MFIs) that operate in India and ser- vice this particular corridor. We believe that these microinsurance prod- ucts would not only expand insurance penetration among low-income families but also target the needs of a population heavily involved in remit- tance transactions. MFIs and RSPs have significant profit potential in accessing new sources of revenue and cross-selling to existing customers by implementing this idea as well.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-2,2015,2,Innovative PPP (public-private partnership) Model for Promoting Financial Deepening and Inclusion in the Rice Value Chain in Nigeria,,,,Nigeria,Agricluture,,"The goal of the proposal is to provide a practical and scalable innova- tive solution for improving access to customized financing for smallholder farmers in the rice value chain, thus promoting sustainable poverty reduc- tion in Nigeria.
This proposal first examines the challenges of smallholder rice farmers, including inadequate institutional frameworks and agricultural policies, limited access to financing, and lack of adequate storage facilities. In addi- tion, there are gender-related social issues: the land tenure system makes it even more difficult for female smallholder farmers to acquire land for cultivation, inhibiting their ability to reach their full productive and income-generating potential.
Our proposal proffers the development of an automated warehousing receipt system to improve access to customized financing for smallholder farmers in Nigeria’s rice value chain. It demonstrates this through an inno- vative public-private partnership (PPP) model, the potential of private sec- tor capabilities, and public sector resources to improve smallholder farmers’ access to financing using movable assets such as inventory as collateral to secure loans and get better access to agricultural inputs.
To implement our solution, we propose a consortium of government agencies, private sector partners such as agribusinesses and small and medium enterprises (SMEs); financial institutions including microfinance institutions; and smallholder farmers and cooperatives. Factors for success of the solution include a clear understanding of roles and responsibilities, risk and benefit sharing, mainstreaming of efficiency-enhancing informa- tion technology innovations, and measures to ensure equal participation of men and women.

2015-3,2015,3,Decreasing Poverty in the Mining Communities of the World through the Empowerment of Communities in the Control of Mining Royalty Funds: An Application to the Peruvian Case,,,,Peru,Mining,,"Although mining gives governments in many countries access to significant resources through taxes on the mining of minerals, governments often fail to invest such funds in projects aimed at the human development of their populations. Our proposal grounds itself in the case of Peru, in pur- suit of a strategy that increases the effectiveness of how mining royalties are spent in satisfying the needs of the population. First, we propose the use of qualitative indicators to prioritize projects objectively. Subsequently, we focus on the involvement of an external agent of information and control given the task of informing the population of how local government actors are spending mining royalties. We then propose the idea of a project incubator that would serve to finance, implement, and monitor initiatives involving investments in infrastructure and capacity building. Last, should irregularities in the use of mining royalties be found, we propose a mecha- nism by which civil society may raise its complaint to the level of the National Comptroller enabling that office to investigate the validity of such claims. This would be possible through a link between the National Comptroller and the committees of vigilance and oversight of mining communities.",3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cooking","- Broad scope to all developing nations that use Open Fires to cook due to lack of electricity.
- Focuses on restructuring bonds to drive long term growth in the region
- ""This proposed bond model enhances the current structure of DIBs financially, while also building in an innovative component that supports local training, education, and knowledge sharing.""
-  ""Unlike previous versions of DIBs, our model not only provides enhanced financial access to clean cookstove technology, but also furnishes the resources to train local individuals on the maintenance, distribution, and sales of the  cookstoves. This structure enables adoption to occur in a culturally sensitive, sustainable way that empowers citizen involvement and adoption."" ","Millions of people in developing countries use open fires and inefficient cookstoves for meal preparation, resulting in the production of toxic smoke that kills over 4 million people per year. Access to clean cook- stove technology for citizens at the bottom of the economic pyramid can be directly improved through a participatory model of Development Impact Bonds (DIBs). This proposed bond model enhances the current structure of DIBs financially, while also building in an innovative component that supports local training, education, and knowledge sharing.
The solution uses existing capital dedicated to the international develop- ment space by philanthropic institutions or nongovernmental organiza- tions (NGOs) to secure and leverage additional investment from the private sector. With mitigated risk, investors seeking long-term holdings will see high rates of return on their unsecured capital commitment, funded by the savings and economic gains realized by governments and NGOs from the impacts of investment. Coupon payments—subject to the predetermined impact outcome being met—will occur at short- and medium-term time junctures, while a final coupon payment and principal repayment will occur at bond maturation. We propose 5-, 10-, and 15-year junctures for the realization of health, environmental, and economic impacts to be achieved from the increased access to clean cookstoves.
Unlike previous versions of DIBs, our model not only provides enhanced financial access to clean cookstove technology, but also furnishes the resources to train local individuals on the maintenance, distribution, and sales of the cookstoves. This structure enables adoption to occur in a culturally sensitive, sustainable way that empowers citizen involvement and adoption. In addi- tion, the model funds the training of local NGO workers on impact measure- ment to demonstrate to investors the impact of their investment.

We seek to make data transparent and accessible. By analyzing each social sector issue and identifying the most effective initiatives that are solving such issues, we aim to drive philanthropy to the most effective organizations.
At the core of our initiative is a dynamic online database of registered non- profit organizations and social sector objectives. Our various products and services enhance and utilize this data source.
Traditionally, organizations compete for aid funding to operate individually. Instead, Impact.PH aims to identify key social sector objec- tives, such as Philippine Development Plan metrics or upcoming Sustainable Development Goals, and identify the most effective organi- zations that can help achieve these goals. This data-driven solution allows funding organizations to have clear, measurable impact metrics and encourages organizations to contribute to a broader mission rather than operate in silos. By increasing access to information, oversight, transpar- ency, and accountability in the nonprofit sector and thereby enhancing nonprofits’ impact, we can establish trust in the effectiveness of the non- profit sector and grow charitable giving. Through this effort, we endeavor to enable intelligence for the social sector, enlighten donors and other stakeholders, build better nonprofits, and collectively solve social sector issues. Our initial target is to actively track at least 1,000 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-registered nonprofit organizations and 20 social sector objectives in two years.

2015-6,2015,6,Introducing Internet-Based Funding Mechanisms for World Bank Operations,,,,NA,"World Bank,
Crowdfunding","- ""This proposal outlines how the World Bank can test  new funding mechanisms using Internet-based donation platforms."" 
- To  meet this objective, the proposal explores the adaptation of existing instruments in the World Bank’s funding toolkit, making them “crowdfunding–friendly.” Specifically, we focus on externally financed outputs with crowdfunding organizations and trust funds that can be replenished by online funding campaigns. 
- The proposal also puts forward a three-year implementation plan to develop and pilot such instruments. The overarching objective is to enable development task teams to supplement their activities with funds gathered directly over the Internet for certain types of technical assistance projects, grant-based financing, or supervision activities. ","Realizing new modalities for funding development interventions is a crucial step in sustaining the post-2015 development agenda. One possible area for new sources of development finance is the crowdfunding marketplace that is estimated to raise $15 billion in 2015 and reach
$93 billion by 2025. This proposal outlines how the World Bank can test new funding mechanisms using Internet-based donation platforms. To meet this objective, the proposal explores the adaptation of existing instruments in the World Bank’s funding toolkit, making them “crowdfunding–friendly.” Specifically, we focus on externally financed out- puts with crowdfunding organizations and trust funds that can be replen- ished by online funding campaigns. Our findings show that the former option has low transaction costs and lends itself to certain types of World Bank grant-based financing operations. The latter involves substantially higher administrative and transaction costs but may be used for larger the- matic engagements. The proposal also puts forward a three-year imple- mentation plan to develop and pilot such instruments. The overarching objective is to enable development task teams to supplement their activities with funds gathered directly over the Internet for certain types of technical assistance projects, grant-based financing, or supervision activities. The proposal also discusses the enabling role of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) community in supporting this initiative by introducing tax deductions for online donations and by possibly matching funds raised online. We believe that implementing such instruments can help lay the groundwork for a new era of international development finance.

Governace",,"Our proposal was first sent to the contest of the Organization of the American States: the TIC Americas Eco-Challenge. While analyzing the rules of the Ideas for Action competition, we asked ourselves, “Is the future of the next generations to admire mechanical animals? Admire plants that are designed in 3D?” Through our Ecoexperiencias “duality” framework, we discovered and redesigned the needs and feasibility of our current business activities in the Mexican southern state of Chiapas. We believe that this grassroots development framework can be applied to different development interventions, ranging from a local approach to a global one. We have applied it to different activities such as the consolidation of our operations’ technological platform, which has allowed us to expand glob- ally, creating a win-win scenario: our local, national, and international customers get immersed in our culture and biodiversity universe, and the Lacandon indigenous group and other local stakeholders benefit from the different touristic services that Ecoexperiencias offers. Based in our frame- work, we explain how the possibility of materializing in Chiapas the “ECODREAMS Biodiversity Guide” in the short term, and in Mesoamerica the “Eco-Modules” in the medium term, can potentialize our kids and youth “Biodiversity Ambassadors” strategy for better governance of biodiversity globally.",NA - Honourable mention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-8,2015,8,Development Impact Bonds: Financing the Treatment of Neglected Tropical Diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,Nigeria,"Development Impact Bonds (DIBs), 
Tropical Diseases",,"We propose the application of Development Impact Bonds (DIBs) to finance projects that aim to alleviate the incidence of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Under DIBs, private investors provide the initial financing for a service provider that then implements a development project. These investors get a return on their investment depending on the success of the project from the donor. We explain why there is scope to improve the current funding mechanisms used to finance the treat- ment of NTDs and how DIBs could both improve the effectiveness of available funds and increase the financing available for such projects. We would achieve this through our modifications to the existing model, which include encouraging competition between investors and creating a Bonus Committee to help align the incentives of these three key agents. Having demonstrated this specifically with our illustrative example— applying DIBs to finance projects treating schistosomiasis in Ondo State, Nigeria—we also argue more generally that DIBs may be a suitable method of financing a variety of different development projects and could play an important role in financing the post-2015 development agenda.",NA - Honourable mention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-9,2015,9,Diaspora Bonds for Small-Business Promotion: Integrating Return Migrants in Developing Countries,,,,NA,"Return Migrants, Skills Development",,"We identify return migrants as an optimal group of potential contributors to the financing of future development. They hold an interest and stake in the future of their home countries and have already been sending remit- tances that are often invested to foster development. Return and circular migrants possess unique skills gained abroad and continue to return home in increasing numbers. We discuss the challenges regarding return migrants’ integration into their home countries’ labor markets and suggest that, through the creation of new small and medium enterprises (SMEs), return migrants can contribute to the economy through a more productive use of their skill sets. Successful SMEs represent an efficient and market-based, bottom-up development approach. Our solution to improve SME promotion is through expanding the use of diaspora bonds as an additional mechanism for funding young enterprises. We argue that development finance in a world of return migration requires creative collaborations between individuals, the private sector, partnerships, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) instead of the maintenance of deep, clear-cut lines between remittances, official development assistance (ODA), and foreign direct investment (FDI).

2015-10,2015,10,Ensuring Effective Implementation of Domestic Resource Mobilization for Successful Delivery of the Post-2015 Development Agenda in Africa,,,,NA,Domestic Resource Mobilization (DRM),- Focus on Domestic Resource Mobilization (DRM),"The post-2015 development agenda will be adopted during the United Nations Summit in September this year, replacing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Although substantial progresses have been made, most African countries have not reached most of the MDGs (1990–2015), partly because of the failure to secure the $64 billion needed per year. Why did Africa fail to secure enough financial resources to meet the MDG targets, and what can be learned to remedy the situation and successfully mobilize resources for effective delivery of the post-2015 development agenda on the continent? Given the contingent nature of external resources, this note considers domestic resource mobilization (DRM) to be the key to effective delivery of the post-2015 development agenda. Literature broadly supports the use of DRM across the continent, but little research has examined the circumstances under which DRM is most successful. This note innovates by proposing a comprehensive, cross- sector, systematic analytical and predictive model that explains the key factors leading to failure or success, providing policy makers with contex- tual and operational policy options to help successfully implement DRM for effective delivery of the post-2015 agenda.",NA - Honourable mention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-11,2015,11,Group Captive Power Plants in Small and Medium-Scale Industrial Clusters in India,,,,India,Energy,- We propose an alternative by setting up pooled group-captive power plants (G-CPPs) in SME clusters of firms that face capital and land constraints. ,"Industrial energy provision from the power grid remains highly unreliable in developing countries, severely affecting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in manufacturing. SMEs are the backbone of the Indian economy, employing 40 percent of the workforce and contributing to 45 percent of manufacturing output. Power outages affect their competitiveness, reduc- ing economic growth and employment rates. As a way out, some firms set up their own backyard captive power plants (CPPs), although most cannot do so because of firm-level financial and infrastructural constraints. The popular residual option is inefficient, environmentally harmful diesel generators and individual CPPs.
We propose an alternative by setting up pooled group-CPPs (G-CPPs) in SME clusters of firms that face capital and land constraints. We assess and identify the differentiating motivators, costs, and constraints for a G-CPP. In our model, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) is set up through investment (equity or cofinanced debt) in a pool of assets by cluster firms. The SPV monitors credit quality deterioration and is administered inde- pendently. Electricity charges are proportional among member firms per their consumption, and surplus electricity is traded, generating additional revenues. Substitution of individual CPPs leads to huge carbon offsetting, which is used to purchase and trade carbon emission reduction (CER) certificates.

2015-12,2015,12,A Hybrid Financing Model for Orphan Diseases,,,,NA,Healthcare,,"Roughly 10 percent of all research and development funds (R&D) spent worldwide are devoted to needs in developing countries, where 90 percent of the world’s population lives. Not surprisingly, then, only 16 of the 1,400 new medicines (or about 1 percent) developed between 1975 and 1999 were for “orphan diseases”—rare diseases that are nonetheless widespread in the developing world, affecting mostly the poorer population. We review and describe several possible reasons for this lack of development and progress before covering existing attempts to solve this financial problem of underinvestment. However, these attempted solutions suffer from struc- tural weaknesses resulting in asymmetric information and moral hazard, redundancy, and suboptimal capital allocation. Finally, we review the drug development process as well as the common framework of interaction between venture capital investors and R&D firms, after which we consider a model that exploits that structure to align incentives and solve the afore- mentioned problems. We illustrate how our solution overcomes the current market difficulties and conclude with a discussion of its feasibility and potential implementation as a governmental program.

2015-13,2015,13,Improving China’s Health System: Using Internet Finance to Broaden Access and Affordability,,,,China,Healthcare,,"Our vision: We believe that people are born equal—and that they should be equal when facing disease, death, or other serious medical situations, no matter their financial circumstances. Chinese poor people today have a serious problem accessing health and medical treatment. Because the health care system is set up such that up-front payment for medical ser- vices is required regardless of any refunds received at a later date, lower- income peasants are often effectively shut out of care.
We want to build an Internet finance platform to help resolve this problem.
The timing is right because of two recent areas of reform in Chinese government policies: (1) rural land rights, registration, and certification work; and (2) rural land circulation. Together, these reforms provide peas- ants with high-quality, semiliquid collateral for which the property right had not been established before, opening up the possibility of pledging these assets against small loans to fund the up-front costs of medical treatment.
Internet finance has become a new, rapidly growing industry in China after taking its cue from popular U.S. models, but most such efforts in China to date have focused narrowly on consumer finance. We propose to apply this concept to the health care sector to provide convenient and effi- cient finance access for those in need.

2015-14,2015,14,The International Remittance Foundation: An Innovative Way to Mobilize Remittances for Economic Development and Bring the Most Basic Services to the Poor,,,,,Remittance,,"Global remittances exceed the size of global development aid by almost three times. Yet, they are a largely untapped source of financing develop- ment. This proposal showcases a new, elegant method of funding interna- tional development projects using remittances. The idea is to establish the International Remittance Foundation (IRF), an innovative and indepen- dent organization designed to leverage remittance flows to fulfill the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and bring the most basic services to the poor. By serving as a nonprofit provider of money transfer services, the IRF would apply revenues not used for money transfer operations toward a series of development initiatives aimed at assisting the commu- nities that receive remittances through the IRF. As a sustainable solution for funding economic development, the proposed agency will allow a country’s diaspora to drive their home country’s economic development and the home country’s civil society to design interventions without fund- ing from political institutions. With a total of $350 billion remitted each year around the globe, the IRF offers a unique, scalable solution to financ- ing development. The IRF would offer tailored fee structures and with- drawal venues that would appeal to citizens, while the IRF’s nonprofit status would allow for tax exemption and for a significant cost advantage over competitors.",NA - Honourable mention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-15,2015,15,Shark Tank Africa: Inspiring Innovators and Ecosystems through Aspirational Media,,,,,,,"Efforts to support innovation and entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa have increased enthusiasm for start-ups but have not addressed persistent mental models that hinder innovation. Depending on the country, mental models may include a romanticized view of entrepre- neurship, mistrust of investors, low risk tolerance, and preference for traditional careers. The “Shark Tank Africa” television show concept aims to change the mental models of entrepreneurs, investors, and the broader viewership in select African markets. The show will do this by demonstrating the qualities of successful businesses and entrepreneurs, the best practices in investing, and the value of innovation and entrepre- neurship to society. Much like its American counterpart, the reality- style program will follow several different entrepreneurs each week in their quest to secure investment. However, unlike the U.S. version of the show, “Shark Tank Africa” will highlight innovations in socially oriented industries (such as health care, agriculture, and energy). Backstories of the entrepreneurs will demonstrate the real “entrepreneurial journey,” and investor pitches and negotiations will illustrate how the investor-entrepreneur relationship can be one of trust and transparency. Investments on the show will encourage viewers who are investors to take risks and become more involved in their local communities. Episodes will prompt viewers to get involved in entrepreneurship through spotlights on incubators, accelerators, and other initiatives in the region. Contestants on the show can also advertise crowdfunding campaigns for their start- ups, which will drive traffic to new crowdfunding platforms and to other listed companies seeking funding. “Shark Tank Africa” will stimulate domestic investment for promising social enterprises that are tackling major development challenges.

2015-16,2015,16,Surya: A Public-Private Partnership Model for Agricultural Development in India,,,,India,"Agriculture,
PPP",,"Surya addresses the prevalence of diesel-powered pumps in Indian agricul- ture. These devices burden farmers with high operational costs, which in turn decrease their yield and lead to lower revenue and profits. The Indian government has, in the past, provided subsidies to facilitate the adoption of electric pumps. This does not work because the required supporting infrastructure is not available in many parts of the country.
Surya tackles this problem through a concerted effort by all stake- holders in three distinct phases: First, the diesel systems are replaced by solar-powered pumps provided through a proposed association between the government, pump manufacturers, and credit institutions. Second, a financial ecosystem is developed to facilitate loan repayment by creating a dynamic marketplace through a partnership between the government and agricultural exporters, using information technology solutions to eliminate a number of inefficiencies in the existing grain distribution sys- tem. Third, the farmers receive consultancy services that enable them to use their solar-powered system efficiently to create a sustainable impact.
We propose Madhya Pradesh as the region for a pilot version of Surya and identify possible partner institutions in the state. The proposal ends by summarizing all the costs that would be incurred and the benefits that would accrue to the farming population of the state.

2015-17,2015,17,Tit for Tatting: Empowering Community End Users in Determining Resource Use and Allocation for Domestic Resource Mobilization and Improved Efficiency in Public Spending,,,,,Public Policy,,"There is a growing despair syndrome in Africa evidenced by a growing credibility deficit between the governed and those who govern. This credi- bility deficit has its roots in catastrophic governance, weak institutions, cosmetic democracy, and corruption, making it difficult to efficiently allocate and use resources. Our solution approaches this reality from the bottom, by focusing on what communities can do to increase community- level participation in resource governance. We posit that participative governance, participative democracy, and people-based approaches that integrate community voices in local community resource use and allocation are key tools in achieving more-efficient resource allocation and use in local communities. We emphasize the need to integrate structured community participation into the life cycle of community projects to guarantee greater efficiency in the stewardship of both influence and afflu- ence.

However, in developing economies and emerging markets there are numerous challenges that make access diffi- cult. Most prominent are the lack of standardized addressing systems, and inefficient or inadequate countrywide postal infrastructure that raises the cost of logistics, especially in delivery at the last mile.
Our proposal recommends a low cost peer-to-peer delivery system where senders are connected to local transporters who can carry out sched- uled or on-demand deliveries. This system will be executed by means of a technology platform that facilitates this interaction between the different customer segments. There is significant opportunity and potential in estab- lishing this service in emerging economies around the world that face sim- ilar problems.

Its goal is to reduce unemployment through increased transparency in the slum labor market of Mumbai by improving access to employment information and opportu- nities. NaukriSearch is unique from other attempts at unemployment reduction because it emphasizes use of technology that is readily available to each segment of the labor market: Internet-enabled computers for employers, and cellular SMS messages for employees. This system enables slum residents to receive accurate, up-to-date information concerning potential employment opportunities within their region.
The majority of slum residents are employed informally. NaukriSearch will provide crucial structure this economic informality. This proposal demonstrates the appropriateness of a dual platform system for a highly asymmetric Indian labor market in which employers enjoy disproportion- ate access to information. Through the implementation of electronic mar- keting campaigns easily accessible to slum populations, our team seeks to attract marginalized workers to NaukriSearch, thereby reducing frictional unemployment in the informal economy.

HerLife uniquely caters to CWMs by providing education on life insurance, requir- ing a partner insurer to waive and fund premiums for three years based on contingent, women-specific life events (e.g., diagnosis of malignancies of female organs), and allowing CWMs to pay premiums suited to varying financial needs while accommodating the insurance provider’s policies. HerLife is also a launch pad to which other women-specific insurance products can be added.

2016-5,2016,5,Innovative Floating Rate Green Bond for the Reduction of Air Pollution in China—An Application to the Shanxi Province’s Case,,,,China,Air Pollution,,"Green Bonds combine fixed income financial instruments with the need to raise capital for low-carbon or green projects—assets or business activities and an environmental benefit.1 With rising capital needs for funding green projects, a growing investor focus on green financial instruments, and mature corporations’ awareness regarding social responsibilities, the vol- ume of total green bonds has increased constantly in the past few years. There are many successes in financing sustainable programs and promot- ing green initiatives in a global context. However, China, both a major air polluter and a country that suffers from deterioration of air quality, still lags far behind in the development of green bonds.2
Shanxi province is among the regions most severely affected by air pol- lution. This area, the main provider of coal resources in China, is highly dependent on revenue from coal and mining and their affiliated indus- tries, and is exposed to devastating air pollution challenges. However, the deceleration of economic growth and consequential lack of government funding hinder the local government’s ability to support sufficient invest- ment in air pollution reduction initiatives, especially within high-carbon emission industries.

2016-6,2016,6,"A New Model for Impact Investing:
Application of Impact  Units to Assess Feasibility of Social Investment Opportunities and Interventions in Kenya
",,,,Kenya,Impact Investing,,"An important driver of achieving Sustainable Development Goals, impact investing encourages social interventions that increase access to basic ser- vices such as finance, healthcare, education, clean water, and energy. Despite the growth in African economic activity, the need for high impact social interventions remains high.1 The generally low level of development in Third World countries continues to provide opportunities for impact investing through the creation of products and services that contribute to improved social, financial, and environmental welfare of local beneficiaries.
East Africa is one of the centers of global impact investing, with a dis- bursement of more than US$9.3 billion over the past five years.2 Kenya accounts for nearly half of the impact capital disbursed in East Africa. However, there is little evidence of differences that can be traced to specific impact investments. Results sometimes appear ambiguous, and many claims attributed to impact interventions are often unsubstantiated.
Our proposal introduces an impact performance measurement and val- uation tool (“Impact Units”) that will enable impact creators (such as local innovating companies, or non-profit organizations, or for-profit institu- tions running Community Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives) to develop social interventions that demonstrate real and measurable impact as measured and certified by our proposed Impact Units.
In summary, the impact creator (most likely an entrepreneur) develops interventions targeting social impact, we (Wylde International) convert the benefits of the interventions into Impact Units which then enables the impact creator to source for buyers of the Impact Units depending on the extent of the fit between the Impact Units buyers’ objectives and the impact creators’ interventions.
The resulting better fit between the impact buyers’ objectives and the impact creators’ interventions increases the possibility that the most deserving of beneficiaries get to benefit from creators of socially inclined interventions.

2016-7,2016,7,"A Novel Practice for Mobile Money Payments: Using Fingerprints to Enable Real-Time Transactions in Nelamangala, India",,,,India,"Payments, 
Figerprints",,"In order to improve business environments in developing economies via innovative private/public partnerships, Paysa will establish cashless payment systems using fingerprint authentication in rural India. We will con- nect people’s fingerprints to their bank accounts and enable transfers from the customer’s bank account to the merchant’s bank account. We believe there is a large potential for growth because roughly only 50 percent of the global adult population holds bank accounts and the majority of this finan- cially unserved adult population live in developing countries. Our pro- posed payment process can be accessible to illiterate people because it uses fingerprints as an identification method.
Our solution to enable acceptance of mobile money payments is to partner with a local bank to encourage users to switch from cash to cash- less cell phone based transactions. We will develop a fingerprint authori- zation system connected with mobile phones or computers integrated with a biometric database to support cashless transactions between busi- ness owners and customers. In order to purchase items, the customer will place his or her finger on the fingerprint scanner, which is connected to a phone or computer. We will provide the scanner to the merchant. Our software will then go through a pre-existing database of fingerprints, Aadhaar, based in India and one of the world’s largest biometric identification systems, to verify the customer’s identity, thereby enabling the transaction.
To narrow our focus for the pilot program, we have chosen the region of Nelamangala, with a population of 37, 232 (Census India 2011). Furthermore, we included the fingerprint concept because it is a creative and secure approach and it is unique to one’s identity and difficult to alter. Using fingerprints as a form of identification meets our goal of ensuring user-friendliness by taking into account varying levels of literacy and cul- tural values in rural areas. Through our research, we have seen that using fingerprints as a form of signature is a norm in India. With the support of a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, we aim to execute our pilot at the beginning of next year by targeting the unbanked population to reduce poverty and increase financial mobility.

2016-8,2016,8,"Agency Organization System: A Financing Model for Revolutionizing the e-Waste Recycling Business in Guiyu, China",,,,China,e-Waste Recycling,,"We observed that with the increasing popularity of electronic appliances, proper disposal has become a global concern. Unlike traditional waste, including plastics, paper packaging, and leftover food, e-waste usually includes a broad variety of materials, some of which are extremely valuable but require advanced technology to extract. Recycling costs for e-waste are extremely high, causing most producers to opt for a simple way out—ship- ping them away and disposing of them untreated.
Guiyu, where we base our research, is one of the final destinations for untreated e-waste. Pollution caused by e-waste has destroyed farmland, and people living there have had to find alternative sources of income. By using crude methods such as burning and manual dismantling, they contribute to the recycling industry, yet this process creates even more hazards to the environment and to workers. Breaking this vicious cycle is the motivation for the Agency Organization (AO) system.
We determined that the current situation is caused by a deadlock in financial inefficiency: producers ship e-waste to Guiyu merely for disposal, without any value gained; established recyclers purchase locally disman- tled parts through an exploitative “recycling business;” workers purchase necessities from vendors at an inflated cost. The AO system will address these problems in a sustainable manner.
The AO aims to replace all unnecessary “middlemen,” thus reducing financial inefficiency. It uses a step-by-step approach: first, with help from the government, it attempts to establish relationships with recyclers and local workers, better clustering both the supply and demand sides’ needs, and building a foundation for its further development.
Secondly, it organizes local workers through a membership scheme— this replaces the current freelance mode of production, and enables the AO to collect data concerning the local available workforce, as well as starting to form a systematic way of channeling e-waste to the local workers.
Thirdly, building upon the previous foundations, the AO can then work to increase the efficiency between recyclers and local workers, by provid- ing training to members, increasing their specific dismantling skills, and making them capable of specialization. At the same time, the AO would serve as a center for daily necessities, using a credit system fueled by members’ active participation in the scheme. This step replaces the mid- dleman that causes inefficiency, i.e., the vendors who supply necessities to workers.
As a final step towards making the AO a sustainable device, we pro- pose the usage of a “Green Dot” licensing scheme. End-product produc- ers who use materials recycled through the AO would be granted a license to use the “Green Dot.” The business incentive to obtain the “Green Dot” license would differ according to the ratio of materials recy- cled. If the ratio of expensive materials is higher, the “Green Dot” is intended to become a hallmark for luxury brands, signifying corporate social responsibility and awareness towards the e-waste problem; con- versely, if the ratio of ordinary materials is higher, the “Green Dot” would serve as an official proof that the producers correspond with the “Go Green” policy by the government.

2016-9,2016,9,Improving the Quality of Life for Artisans from Rural Communities through Empowerment of Women,,,,Mexico,Women Empoerment,,"During the period from 2012 to 2014, the number of poor increased in Mexico in the from 53.3 to 55.3 million, which represents an increase from
45.5 to 46.2 percent of the country’s population, according to the National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (CONEVAL 2014).
CONVEAL indicates many reasons that the number of people falling into poverty has risen:
1.        Lower revenues.
2.        Low economic growth.
3.        Population dynamics and inequality.
4.        Insufficient income to provide for basic needs
Further according to FONART (National Fund for the Development of Arts and Crafts) in Mexico there are more than 10 million people were employed in a craft or an activity related to a craft, although currently there is no national census that allows us to identify the exact number of artisans in Mexico by state.
Most of the people engaged in artisanal activity in the first quarter of 2011 had low incomes that put the artisans below the poverty line.
One of the main problems regarding Mexican crafts is the marketing process. According to Rafaela Luft Dávalos, few craftsmen export their products and there is a need to “promote a legal framework for the defense of handicrafts, mainly to combat piracy.”
We proposed to create a development program that promotes commu- nity empowerment through projects that take advantage of the wealth of communities and enable them to integrate their social fabric, improve  their income, and maintain harmony with the environment.
 

Our goals are to:
1.        Identify areas of opportunity in communities through ethnographic studies, field visits, and identification of community leaders.
2.        Work with community leaders in detecting needs and strengths of their group to be able to work toward the integration of a productive project.
3.        Design a plan of implementation where we elaborate technical feasibil- ity studies, both marketing and financial, as well as advice on structur- ing the project for searching and management of public funding for a link with social investors.
4.        Support the marketing of products made by these groups, helping to connect them to national and international markets through our social platform, bringing them closer to potential market niches.
The program will empower rural communities in states like Yucatán, Guanajuato, Querétaro and Hidalgo. It can especially help women with microenterprise development and significantly improve the income of rural communities.

2016-10,2016,10,"Reinventing Global Payment Processing for Migrant Remittances, Microenterprise Funding Infusions and Nationwide Direct Benefit Transfers (DBTs)",,,,,"Remittances,
Global Payments",,"Centralized financial systems have formed the core of international finance for decades. The obvious advantage is that a financial institution acting as counterparty adds trust, and the provision of a singular, institutionally held transaction “ledger” obviates the need for third-party authentication. However, this centralization has added costs that are passed on to end-us- ers: our proposal is an attempt to look at the value that can be added by switching to a decentralized payment processing system that can be cur- rency-neutral, scalable, robust, and built on top of a system of publicly ver- ifiable transactions. In order to understand the actual impact that such technology can provide, we look at the benefits of implementing this sys- tem for international remittances by migrants, Direct Benefit Transfers, and national subsidy schemes, and in the funding of grassroots projects by international donors.
Contextually, staggering losses—as high as 50 percent—are observed in end-to-end transmission for aid programs. Broadly, there are three sys- temic causes:
1.        Systemic corruption enabled by layered centralization;
2.        Consolidation of control/access by middlemen, and distinct informa- tion asymmetry; and
3.        Inefficiencies of transmission systems for smaller trade quanta.
The suggested implementation looks at Blockchain technology—the backbone of cryptocurrencies1 such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum. The efficiency offered by this technology, together with its fully traceable nature presents a unique opportunity to tackle systemic corruption, distri- bution failures, and the onerous fees levied by monopolistic payment pro- cessors. This implementation is not seen presently in a holistic form, but is built up of individual components that are well established and whose effi- cacy has been verified empirically on a local and global scale.
Beyond our proposal, the exact technical decisions will need to be explored further. Options include “forking,” which is building a custom copy of an existing cryptocurrency protocol, or building upon existing freeform systems such as Ethereum that allow programming smart con- tracts directly into the software. Since the recommendations in the pro- posal could essentially be assembled on top of existing and available platforms, the feasibility of the project is considerably high.
Given the nature of the gains made by this proposed system, it is observed that the most potential is for developing nations that often bear the brunt of institutional financial inefficiencies.
Considering the novelty of the technology discussed here, a few signifi- cant challenges pose themselves: low market depth for individual crypto- currencies mean high volatility; lack of oversight is seen as inherently threatening by global governments, who also drag their feet when it comes to unexpected jumps in technologies with far-reaching consequences.

Warehousing",,"Most of the world’s poorest people are smallholder farmers. At least 570 million farms worldwide are smallholdings, with more than 475 million of those farms owned by families who cultivate less than two hectares of land. In Nigeria, 70 percent of the working population, or about 121 million people, are farmers. In Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, agriculture accounts for 64 percent of the labor force and 75 percent of the people who survive on less than $1 per day work in the agricultural sector. This level of poverty results primarily from very low yields, compared with global yield aver- ages, as well as from very high postharvest losses. Annual postharvest losses range between 40 percent and 60 percent, depending on the value chain being considered. After years of trying to find solutions to low crop yields, we formed the Kitovu Technology Company and developed the Kitovu platform. The Kitovu team consists of a passionate group of young people who have experience in agriculture, processing, and consultancy services within the African agricultural value chain.
The Kitovu team firmly believes that improving the use of inputs by farmers has the potential to lift millions of smallholder farmers out of pov- erty. But for that to be feasible, a system must be in place that matches the right composition and quantity of fertilizers, good quality or improved seeds, and other inputs to farms’ actual soils and sites. These practices would improve yields and consequently increase farmers’ incomes.
This report describes how the Kitovu platform solves the problem of low yields and explains the platform’s estimated effects on poverty and social well-being.

As a result, women with breast cancer are more likely to receive treatment in time for full recovery, and women who are blind gain employment and social standing.
Uganda is a developing country with a population of approximately 42 million people. More than 56 percent of the population is female, and more than 85 percent live without access to good health facilities. This situation has led to significant loss of life. Good health care is needed in Uganda, but health services are very expensive and few people can afford them.
Uganda is among the African countries most affected by breast cancer. Breast cancer has increased drastically over the past 10 years. The Breast Cancer Working Group report from Makerere Medical School states that more than 30,000 women have breast cancer and more than 2,500 women die from the disease annually in the country. Dr. Fred Okuku, a medical oncologist at Mulago Hospital in Uganda, said in his medical report of 2014 that there is an additional unknown number of women dying from undiagnosed breast cancer.
 
Uganda has more than 1.6 million people who are blind. Socially, people who are blind are looked on as misfits, nonproductive people, and depen- dents. They are discriminated against and marginalized in society. More than 99.5 percent of them are not employed even though many have received rehabilitation and some are university graduates. These individu- als have a genius sense of touch that would enable them to detect breast cancer early once they have received medical training.

It has a population of about 130 million, 80 percent of whom are below the poverty line of US$1 a day. Of those, 15 million people belong to the fisher community, all of whom live below the poverty line and are classified by the government as an extremely backward caste. Fish is the staple diet in the region, with annual  consumption  of  fish  at US$1 billion, but Bihar suffers from a gap between demand and supply of more than 232 million kilograms of fish per year (US$390 million). To fulfill that unmet demand, Bihar is importing fish from neighboring states through unorganized channels.
Agratam India works in the state of Bihar to convert low-lying and unproductive wastelands into productive fish farming units. The project primarily aims to provide sustainable employment opportunities to the members of the extremely poor fisher community, who do not have access to a consistent and stable source of income. By aggregating the unproduc- tive parcels of land held by smallholder farmers, Agratam also provides these farmers with rental income on land from which they otherwise extract negligible value or economic returns.
Agratam’s aim is to use existing natural resources in an economically productive and sustainable manner to create income-generating opportu- nities for the poorest sections of the community.1 The holistic model focuses on converting unproductive land mass into profit-generating assets, thereby creating employment, stabilizing incomes, developing skills, and addressing food security and malnutrition, all of which contribute to the sustainable development of underserved rural communities.

At its core, Project Forward facilitates the moneti- zation of volunteer hours through a proprietary digital currency.
Within the United States alone, there is a stark drop-off in the rates of volunteerism. In the past 12 years volunteer rates fell from 28.8 percent in 2003 to 24.9 percent in 2015 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2003; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2016). While there are several theories as to why the rate of volunteerism is declining, it is clear that not-for-profit organiza- tions are having less success encouraging people to engage and become more active in their communities. To cultivate meaningful and long lasting engagement, organizations that rely on volunteers must entertain the thought of creating a more comprehensive incentive.
The use of digital currencies continues to increase. Technology has cre- ated the next wave of transactional components that banks and individuals alike have begun to adopt: a new medium of exchange involving digital wallets and smart contracts. To expand this usage and create something that will yield a better value structure, Project Forward has married two vitally beneficial functions.

It is an avenue that uplifts human dignity. Given its importance, sanitation should be available and accessible to all; no one should lack proper sanitation. An elixir to the many challenges the world is facing, sanitation is a right and a responsibility of all.
Most Filipinos who belong to the base of the pyramid (BoP) openly defecate in the fields, bushes, and seashores, which poses a wide range of risks to human health and the environment. To help those low-income communities gain access to proper sanitation, Team SAVE proposes to provide them with portable sanitation units. The Portable Toilet Solution (PTS), which is based on a utility business model, depends on two levels of cross-subsidies: (a) between the water supply and sanitation services and (b) across customer classes, to make the system available and afford- able for all.
To ensure sustainability of the program and address the lack of aware- ness about the importance of sanitation, the program must be a collabora- tion between the public and private sectors and should involve the target communities.
The proposal will be piloted in the province of Laguna. The program’s implementation will benefit from the existing public-private partnership between the provincial government of Laguna and Laguna Water, a water and wastewater service provider. The program can then be replicated and scaled up elsewhere in the Philippines and in other developing countries.

In our solution, the World Bank plays an important role in disentangling sovereign risk from commodity risk, making the commodity bond market more attrac- tive to both debt issuing countries and private sector lenders. We illustrate the proposal with an application to Mongolia—a country with over 40 per- cent of export revenue from copper alone. Finally, we present a practical implementation plan to create a large, liquid commodity bond market that would present a new option for CDDCs to increase economic resilience and enhance long-term growth.

2017-8,2017,8,Filling the Credit Gap: Improving SME Accounting Standards and Data Collection in India,,,,,,,"The growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is critical to the overall economic growth of developing nations. However, many businesses in developing economies do not have sufficient access to the financing they need—they often lack both the financial data and the collateral necessary to acquire loans. Alternative lending, which takes advantage of nontradi- tional data sources, has the potential to mitigate this issue. However, surveys of alternative lenders suggest that a lack of proper accounting data currently hinders the ability of SMEs to obtain financing from these lend- ers. Consequently, alternative lending has yet to make a meaningful dent in the current SME credit gap.
To address this issue, the DataRISE team proposes a comprehensive, dual-platform solution available to both SMEs and alternative lenders. This system would take advantage of existing digital payment infrastructure to greatly improve accounting practices for SMEs and make these data readily available to alternative lenders, thereby reducing customer acquisition costs and enabling greater scale. By better connecting previously excluded businesses to lenders, our platform has the potential to boost SME growth in developing nations around the world. Currently, recent developments and economic conditions in India make the country an optimal environ- ment to implement our solution. Eventually, this service can expand to other emerging markets.

At issue is how that energy should be produced—fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions are making dras- tic changes in the climate, leading to big problems.
Government data show that Rwanda’s national electrification rate has reached 41 percent (11 percent off-grid, 30 percent on-grid). Over 7 million people still lack access to electricity. The government is targeting 100 per- cent electricity access by 2024. To reach this target, off-grid solutions will be used in remote areas, far from the on-grid network.

We believe a digital ledger system known as blockchain technology is the most effective solution in tackling the issues of food safety and food fraud. The transparency and traceability of blockchain technology connects all parties (producers, retailers, consumers) in the blockchain network and ensures an improved food supply chain. In addition, the implementation of blockchain technology will have positive ripple effects on growth and development.

2018-6,2018,6,Concrete from Plastics? Preserve Natural Resources and Produce Sustainable Construction Materials,,,,,"Enviroment,
Construction",,"Every year, more than 8 million metric tons of plastic are deposited into the ocean, the equivalent of emptying a garbage truck full of plastic every min- ute into the ocean (World Economic Forum 2016).
The construction sector is responsible for 40 percent of the virgin mate- rials extracted from the earth, 40 percent of the energy consumed on earth (including energy in use), 20–30 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions, and 50 percent of the total waste generated (UNEP-SBCI 2014).
The construction sector’s exploitation of sand and gravel, which are non- renewable resources, represents the largest volume of material extraction worldwide after water. The carbon dioxide emissions generated by the extraction and the transport of sand and gravel affect biodiversity, water turbidity, erosion of the earth’s crust, and the climate (UNEP 2014).
According to the United Nations’ Environment Program, to mitigate these problems, it is necessary to do the following:
•        Reduce the consumption of sand or gravel; optimize existing infra- structures, recycle concrete debris, or use alternative construction materials such as wood.
•        Establish taxes on the extraction of sand and gravel to encourage the use of economically viable alternatives.
•        Reduce the negative effects of extraction: adapt the extraction rate to the rate of renewal of resources and establish an acceptable extraction limit.
 

To reduce the exploitation of sand and gravel, we propose that the con- struction industry use polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is a plastic, instead of gravel, to manufacture concrete.
With ROCAPET, PET is used as a coarse aggregate for the manufacture of concrete. Replacing a minor percentage of gravel with PET in the man- ufacturing process reduces the annual tonnage of postconsumption PET, preserves a natural resource, and produces a sustainable concrete with lower volumetric weight. This method also reduces the cost of manufactur- ing ready-mix concrete and benefits the environment.
With ROCAPET, it is possible to produce concrete for structural use. Using PET as a minor percentage to the gravel makes the concrete’s resis- tance go from f’c = 250 kg / cm² to f’c = 350 kg / cm², which fulfills the quality requirements of workability (slump), compression, bending, and temperature. In addition, the following results are attained:
•        Slump from 10 to 18 cm
•        Compression resistance: ƒ’c = 150 to 350 kg / cm²
•        Resistance to bending: MR = 41–52 kg / cm²
•        Resistance equal to a traditional concrete subjected to temperatures up to 280° C
The product is suitable for structural use in office buildings, sports facil- ities, housing, and singular constructions.
We must note that these tests are preliminary and that we are still testing new materials to replace the stone aggregates (gravel and sand) because we have not been able to replicate the results from the first tests. We will con- tinue working to optimize the results.

2018-7,2018,7,Effort Provides Sustainable Energy by Turning Biomass to Charcoal in Tanzania,,,,Tanzania,Energy,,"Wood and charcoal are major sources of domestic energy in Tanzania. According to the Tanzania Forest Services Agency, 350,000 to 400,000 hectares (915,000 acres) of forest are harvested each year in Tanzania, mainly for fuel. Studies indicate that about 70 percent of the charcoal pro- duced in the country is sold in the city of Dar es Salaam. Residents of the city have access to both electricity and gas for fuel; however, gas is not a popular option (at least to the majority of Dar es Salaam residents). In Dar es Salaam, about 300,000 bags of charcoal are used daily, the effects of which pose a major threat to the environment in Tanzania.
With these challenges in mind, Green Power Group designed an alterna- tive source of domestic energy. We created a simple electric machine with the capacity to produce 3.5 tons of charcoal briquettes per day. Our product, called MKAA WA IDRIS, is a carbonized charcoal briquette that is manufac- tured from biomass wastes such as peanut shells, rice husks, coconut shells, sawdust, and other agricultural byproducts. In Tanzania, 85 percent of waste comes from the agricultural sector, mainly food and postharvest waste.
Many middle- and low-income families use charcoal as their primary cooking fuel in Tanzania, especially in rural areas. This puts tremendous stress on the environment. By providing these families with access to an alternative source of domestic energy, such as MKAA WA IDRIS, we would contribute to the fight against climate change, as described in goal 13 of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Our innovation is more than just the production of charcoal briquettes; it is a contribution to environmental conservation. The protection and conservation of our natural environment is the cornerstone for the future of humanity. We are passionate in environmental conservation and we use our social media and other platforms not only for customer acquisition but also to advocate for environmental conservation. We encourage young people to use adaptive technology available online to create sustainable solutions for environmental challenges and to create more job opportuni- ties in Tanzania and Africa.

2018-8,2018,8,"In Ghana, Data Analytics Will Match Business Enterprises with Lending Institutions",,,,Ghana,"Data Analytics,
Lending",,"Credit Locus is a virtual platform that matches credit-seeking micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Ghana with lending institutions. For lenders, it is a customer onboarding channel that offers more precision and efficiency in acquiring “qualified” borrowers. For microbusiness owners, this platform offers access to tailored credit facilities as well as to share power with lenders by allowing them to choose which loan offer to accept. The platform uses traditional and alternative data to create a hybrid score- card that serves as an efficient alternative to traditional credit appraisal mechanisms. It prioritizes a lending model (supply-chain financing) that ensures that loan defaults are minimized, especially the ones that are induced by diverted funds. Shrewd data analytics on the platform also reduce the loan turnaround time as the volume of lending increases.
Comprehensive research conducted by the Credit Locus team indicated that financial institutions constantly develop cold feet when varying their credit appraisal process to suit the needs and structure of MSMEs. However, with the formal lending market gradually becoming saturated in Ghana and with nonperforming loans hitting the roof, lenders are on the lookout for ways to enter the informal market, which has great potential for returns but disproportionate market data. The solution we came up with, Credit Locus, intends to bridge this gap by focusing on complementarity rather than disruption. In essence, we are not replacing the traditional system but providing an answer to the often-asked question: How can we improve it? We have built a balanced team to suit the impending demands of run- ning this business. With solid individual backgrounds in software develop- ment, social entrepreneurship, and investment banking, coupled with our collective desire for continuous learning and lifting others, the team is well equipped to execute every mandate we have set for ourselves. In carrying out our work, we will generate credit footprints for microbusinesses, which
is essential to create an all-inclusive financial sector in Ghana.

2018-10,2018,10,Reduce Trash from E-Commerce Packaging and Improve China’s Environment,,,,China,"Environment,
Packaging",,"In the past decade, there has been a rapid growth in retail e-commerce sales worldwide. Between 2014 and 2018, sales grew by more than 20 per- cent annually. Packaging waste is a major byproduct of this rapidly grow- ing market. China’s e-commerce market—the largest in the world with nearly half of all sales globally—produces as much as 160,000 tons of trash daily from e-commerce delivery packaging. This poses a great threat to the sustainability of this market. Overpackaging is a major factor leading to the severity of the problem. It is estimated that in 2011 more than 50 per- cent of all packages sent in China were subject to overpackaging. This phe- nomenon may be caused by the high number of damaged products delivered by low-cost couriers. For online retailers, the durability of their packaging became a priority over environmental concerns.
EcoPack proposes an artificial intelligence–based optimal packaging system that seeks the best compromise between reducing packaging and maintaining adequate protection for products. Backed by data obtained from users’ feedback and online data sources, EcoPack’s solution would apply machine-learning algorithms to generate the best packaging method with the least amount of material while ensuring sufficient protection. EcoPack’s solution would then send the optimized plans to the e-commerce application programming interface, helping sellers to optimize their packaging.
We think the EcoPack solution will remove thousands of tons of trash annually and impel significant environmental improvements in China. The EcoPack team firmly believes that the adoption of this solution will reduce excess packaging waste not only in the e-commerce market of China but also in the global e-commerce market.

2018-11,2018,11,"With SafePal, Confidentially Report Gender Violence and Access Health and Social Services",,,,Uganda,Women Empowerment,,"Discrimination against women and girls and gender-based violence severely affect women and girls’ health. Gender-based violence (GBV) is not only abuse but also a human rights violation and a public health challenge. It is also a barrier to civic, social, political, and economic participation. GBV results in a number of negative consequences for women, including adverse physical and mental health outcomes, limited access to education, increased costs related to medical and legal services, lost household productivity, and reduced income.
Cultural norms and practices that emphasize women and girls in subor- dinate positions perpetuate GBV and other harmful practices including FGM (female genital mutilation), child marriage, and teenage pregnancies; these norms and practices also limit access to decision making, to informa- tion, and to SRH (sexual and reproductive health) services.
It is common for victims and survivors of abuse to not report these attacks because of the social stigma surrounding sexual violence. According to the Uganda Police Crime Report 2017, 30 percent of victims of sexual violence report the incidents within 72 hours, and 70 percent do not receive emer- gency assistance within 72 hours. This delay has contributed to an increase in new HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infections, teenage and unwanted pregnancies, and other sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
SafePal is a platform that people can use to confidentially report cases of GBV and to get access to service providers including health centers, psycho- social support, legal education and mediation, shelters, the police, and local government departments for community development and probation.
SafePal will reduce the time between when a violence is perpetrated and when the survivor reports the attack and receives assistance and access to service providers by providing an accessible reporting platform. Through
 

SafePal’s web application and unstructured supplementary service data system, people can use their mobile device to report cases of abuse anony- mously into the system. The system will also provide a dashboard through which service providers can view survivors who have reported abuse and have requested assistance.
